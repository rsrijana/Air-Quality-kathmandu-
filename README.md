 # Kathmandu Air Quality Analysis (2017–2025) – Power BI & DAX

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **in-depth analysis of PM10 and PM2.5 air pollution trends** in **Kathmandu, Nepal** between **2017 and 2025**.  
Using **Power BI** and **DAX**, the analysis benchmarks air quality values against **WHO 2005 & 2021 air quality guidelines** (both annual and 24-hour limits), identifies seasonal patterns, and visualizes daily & annual exceedances.

**Key Goals:**
- Track changes in PM10 and PM2.5 over time.
- Compare against **WHO air quality standards**.
- Identify **peak pollution periods** and **risk levels**.
- Present findings through **interactive Power BI dashboards**.

## 📏 WHO Benchmark Guidelines Used

| Pollutant | Averaging Time | WHO 2005 AQG (µg/m³) | WHO 2021 AQG (µg/m³) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **PM₂.₅** | Annual         | 10                   | 5                    |
|           | 24-hour        | 25                   | 15                   |
| **PM₁₀**  | Annual         | 20                   | 15                   |
|           | 24-hour        | 50                   | 45                   |

> **Note:** 2021 **annual limits** are used for long-term trend analysis, while **24-hour limits** are applied for daily exceedance comparisons.
